        June 1969: Gays at Stonewall Inn resisted police arrest and rioted. Created the Gay Liberation front
        Individuals were becoming more open and vocal about their sexual orientation

        Created a show, not just music
        Ziggy Stardust
            Had a immeasurable effect on the LGBT community, and issues to sexual identity

    Suzi Quatro
        One of the only women musicians in glam rock

        "I would like to think that Alice Cooper opened the door to theatrics. We were sort of the band that drove the stake throught the heart of the love generation" - Alice Cooper
        Name of the band, but also the name of one of the band members
        Alingned themselves with the movements of the time (Gay, women's, liberation...)
    New York Dolls
        "In 1972 there was only one impressive band in New York, and that was the New York Dolls" - Gene Simmons
    Kiss
        'The basic premise behand Kiss is that we are there to give people a couple of hours of pure escapism." - Gene Simmons
